            <p class="mahir">My name is Mahir Faysal. You might know me and saw me many times. I am a football freak and
                also love
                cricket. I am not a very active person but not the laziest person. I love to watch movies and series if
                it is good. I love to do those things which I like no matter what. I am still not a perfect person but
                trying to be perfect.</p>

            <p class="mahir" id="padding">I still don't know for sure what to become but I am learning web development.
                Although it is
                not easy, still I like it. It requires enough time and patience to learn. I hope in the future I may
                find the best goal for me.</p>

                <p>I am a student studying in inter 1st year. I am currently a student of BNMPC. I am not a very
                    top-level student. My student life is full of many kinds of experiences. I have learned many
                    valuable life lessons and also experienced many memorable moments. I made many friends although they
                    are bastards and also helpful. Thus I am happy with what I have.</p>
